scarabws
========

A rewrite of http://www.kurokatta.org/hacks/scarab as a clojure web service.
Tests scrabble letter combinations.

## Usage

The webservice is currently hosted at `http://mariusposta.info/scarabws` for the moment:
- GET `http://mariusposta.info/scarabws/` for all available languages,
- GET `http://mariusposta.info/scarabws/<language>` for some basic statistics regarding `language`,
- GET `http://mariusposta.info/scarabws/<language>/<letter-query>` for exact- and sub-matches of the letters in `letter_query` for `language`. Lower case letters and '_' for blank tiles only. Append with `?exact` for exact matches only.
